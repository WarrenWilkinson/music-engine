What is music engine? It's a way for LISP to talk to
wireplumber... and Also MIDI to send events. That's all it has to be.

 - It provides for the easy creation of MIDI output channels
   - Lisp can call a function with a name to create another midi output channel.
   - Lisp can then send MIDI control events to these channels.
   - (Some channels will be used to control software like FluidSynth or Sooperlooper, others will be things like Guitar -> Midi)
 - It uses an interface to read the ADCs for the humbuckers
   - One interface is a loopback interface that Lisp can send data too.
   - The other interface will be the real hardware interface.
   - There are knobs lisp can control here: things like octave shifting, midi conversion, turning off strings
   - This shows up as a Midi Output Channel: one per string
   - It also shows up as Audio output channels: one per string after processing
 - It uses an an interface API for all the buttons and proxies them to Lisp.
   - One interface is a loopback interface that Lisp can control.
   - The other interface will be the real hardware interface
 - It provides a wrapper around wireplumber
   - Lisp is notified when new devices are created.
   - Lisps preferences for hooking things up are executed.

What is simulator?  It's a GTK application used to 'pretend' to be the hardware.

  - It will tell lisp when various buttons are pressed.
  - Lisp will tell it what the hardware should look like.
  - It will display a window.

So what is Lisp doing?  It's tying the two systems together and
providing the business logic.
